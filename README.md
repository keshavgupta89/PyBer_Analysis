# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of the Project
The project is about a ride sharing company Pyber. The company has provided us with the data of Cities, Drivers, and their customers.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the project is to merge and analyse the data provided to us and provide a graphical representation of the analysis.

## Result of the Analysis
1. ![Fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90114686/135897488-f1bd2a9b-f99a-4d86-85bc-52ba9d6312b6.png)

The first chart which is scatter and plot chart shows us the average fare per person and Total no of rides per city.
On analysing the data closely we can see that the number of rides per city are less for rural cities but the average fare is high. It is denoted by the yellow circle. We can also see the number of rides per city by the size of the circles plotted on the graph, which are again comparably small then suburban and urban. And the data could be analysed for suburban and urban on the similar basis.

The second chart shows us Ride count data. It shows us the number of rides of different city types. It also shows us mean by the red line which tells us the average rider per city type. Apart from that the chart also shows us an outlier on the urban axis which could be an incorrect data.


3.![Fig3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90114686/135897537-3b7cba67-b91b-4dca-a2e9-63f20c9a8cbd.png)

The third chart shows us the average fare charged from a customer in each city type. We can note that the average fare charged in urban is lowest and highest in rural. We can also check the average fare charged by city type by the red line on the graph.


4.![Fig4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90114686/135897556-eadcde65-a691-4b85-b653-a1fc9d40fe8a.png)

The forth chart shows us the number of drivers driving for pyber in each city type.


5.![Fig5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90114686/135897577-0eac36a4-1330-4f18-8016-65462c4f6d6a.png)


The fifth is a pie chart depicting the percent of revenue(fare) coming from each city. And on seeing the above graph we can easily say that our biggest slice of revenue is coming from Urban cities.

6.![Fig6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90114686/135897593-bdd29297-a79a-4615-8647-57ff9b248597.png)

The sixth is a pie chart depicting the percent of total number of rides coming from each city. And again our biggest slice of rides is coming from Urban cities.


7.![Fig7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90114686/135897777-2b42116e-56f0-45ee-bc7a-db47d63e5588.png)

The seventh is also a pie chart depicting the percent of total number of drivers coming from each city. And again the maximum number of driver is coming from Urban cities.


8![PyBer_fare_summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90114686/135897794-eac0c153-15b4-4ce2-aa68-f334bcc62916.png)

The eight is a line graph which shows total fare earned by pyber in different city types between the period of January and May. We can see how much each city type is doing for each week in revenue(fare) context.  

## Summary:
After analysing the data, we have observed a few things and would like to make following recommendations. 
1. The number of drivers needs to be increased in rural area and suburban areas. The percent of total number of rides coming from rural city is 5.3% whereas the number of drivers is only 2.6%.  Similarly, for the suburban cities the percent of total rides is 26.3% and the percent of drivers for those rides in only 16.5%
So, we need to bridge that gap of Drivers Vs Rides.

2. We would also recommend the company to check the data for West Angela city once again because the data is showing it as an outlier on our chart. 

3. We would also recommend keeping the marketing and advertisement in urban city as highest because that is where we have the maximum rides.
